That's right, we're bringing the power of GraphQL to everyone with open integrations. Every conversation can be made actionable by connecting to your existing CRM or tools you currently use in your business like Shopify to deliver engaging experiences. 

It's easy, here's an example! Suppose a customer's asking for the status of their order. Just drop in a GraphQL query to connect your existing eCommerce platform. Next, test your query by executing a "dry run" to get back the data response. Third, create your own low-code variable `@data(node.status_label)` to specify the location of `key-value pairs` in your GraphQL output and store the result in-memory. Only variables are sent to customers, never your behind the scenes GraphQL API calls.

Finally, have the chatbot send a message like the example above by calling the variable @var(order_status) you created earlier. Customers dislike when Chatbots can't help them. Postage makes it simple to create actionable conversational dialogue flows to power your business with GraphQL and Low-Code approach.

We're developers too and love taking a peek in real-time. Launch the console log to get a hands-on picture of what's happening behind the scenes with your chatbot. Explore how variables are transformed into data while connecting with your existing business tools and data sources over GraphQL API. Take it for a spin with one our open templates and see the path detection AI model at work in selecting the next step in your chatbot with nodes connected by multiple edges.
